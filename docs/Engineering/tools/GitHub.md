# Github Education

**Learn to ship software like a pro.** There's no substitute for hands-on experience. But for most students, real world tools can be cost-prohibitive. That's why we created the GitHub Student Developer Pack with some of our partners and friends.

**NOTE** : This list is not exhaustive, and the specific offers may change over time. Students should visit the GitHub Education website to see the current offerings and eligibility requirements.

## Signing up

1. Go to the [GitHub Education Pack](https://education.github.com/pack) page. 
2. Sign up for a GitHub account if you don't have one.
3. Under "Select your role in education", select Student. In the "Application" dialog, enter the name of your school. If required, select or add the email address you use for school.

4. Click Continue, and then you will be prompted to upload proof of your academic status. 
> Ensure that you use your `Christ ID` card as your proof of academic status for best chances of getting accepted.

5. Verify your application details, then click Process my application.

If your application is approved, you'll receive a confirmation email. Applications are usually processed within a few days, but it may take longer during peak times, such as during the start of a new semester.

::: tip NOTE
If, after clicking the Process my application button, you see a banner asking you to fix something in your application, you should fix it and then click Reprocess my application.
