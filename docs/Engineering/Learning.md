# Engineering Learning Resources

Here are websites that take explaining concepts to the next level. They have clear, visually understandable and interactive papers that will help you understand core concepts as well as cutting edge technology.

## **Research & Advanced Learning**

### **[Distill.pub](https://distill.pub)**
A modern medium for presenting research. The web is a powerful medium to share new ways of thinking. Over the last few years we've seen many imaginative examples of such work. But traditional academic publishing remains focused on the PDF, which prevents this sort of communication.

- **Why it's great**: New notations, visualizations, and mental models can deepen our understanding. By nurturing the development of such new ways of thinking, Distill enables new discoveries.

### **[VISxAI](https://visxai.io)**
VISxAI is a dedicated platform exploring the intersection of visualization and artificial intelligence. It provides a collection of research papers, interactive demonstrations, and tools focused on making AI systems more interpretable and understandable through visualization techniques.

- **Why it's great**: It bridges the gap between complex AI algorithms and human understanding by showcasing cutting-edge visualization approaches. These visual explanations help researchers and practitioners better comprehend, debug, and trust AI systems, ultimately leading to more responsible and effective AI development.

### **[Neural Networks and Deep Learning](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/index.html)**
Neural Networks and Deep Learning is a free online book that provides a comprehensive introduction to neural networks and deep learning concepts. The book takes a first-principles approach to explain the fundamental ideas behind these technologies.

- **Why it's great**: It offers clear explanations of complex topics with interactive examples and visualizations, making it accessible for beginners while still providing depth for more advanced readers. The book systematically builds understanding from basic neural networks to more complex deep learning architectures, with hands-on code examples throughout.
