<h1 class="capsh"> About </h1>

The Centre for Academic and Professional Support is a team of student volunteers who aims to help their peers bridge the gap between the academia and the professional spheres through skill-sharing. The team extends their support to students, faculty, researchers and any individual who would require it. We help them face daunting tasks such as resume writing and appearing for job interviews and more! The volunteers are assisted by research scholars and faculty mentors whose experience and knowledge extend beyond what is taught in classrooms.

What sets the Centre apart from other skill-sharing programs are the volunteers who work purely out of passion, yet staying true to the professionalism that the organization ensures. CAPS dreams of producing holistically developed individuals that can, and want to make a positive impact. 

To make this dream come true, we have dedicated wings that deliver training sessions, host talks by industry experts, and conduct psychometric assessments. An individual whoâ€™s been a part of CAPS can be distinguished from the rest by their professionalism,integrity and eagerness to improve.
