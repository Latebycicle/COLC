# About COLC

The **CAPS Online Learning Center** is a dedicated platform designed to **centralize and organize academic and professional resources** for the students of Christ. Our goal is to provide a structured and accessible hub where students can find the *best* tools, courses, and materials to support their academic and career aspirations.

## Why This Platform?

When I was a student, I found it hard to keep track of what college offered, and in some cases, I didn't even know that college provided certain resources (in my case, MatLab ML certification). Over the years, as I grew more experienced and more accustomed to the industry, I realized that I have a personal repository of resources that I've found useful and that I have used to grow my skills. I had friends asking me where I found out about these things and how I learned them, so I figured the best way to help them is to create a platform where I can share all the resources that I have found useful and that I have used to grow my skills.

This platform is a culmination of my experiences and the resources I have gathered over the years. It is designed to help you navigate the vast array of academic and professional resources available, making it easier for you to find what you need.
